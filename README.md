# CaseLED

This project contains the Arduino sketch needed to control the LEDs installed within my personal computer case. Upon startup, the LEDs cycle through a large list of preset effects automatically that look quite pretty sitting on my desk. The software utilizes my [LedUtilities](https://github.com/BaileyMulhern/LedUtilities) custom library and FastLED for controlling the LED strip. For hardware, the project is Arduino Uno based utilizing a custom soldered proto board to control a strip of WS2812B running off of the power from the PC itself.
